## Course Project "Robotics Gripper"

#### - I Iteration:

       - Open a review article and choose a flu scheme, modeling complexity - 1 hours;       
       - Chosen scheme structural analysis (pictures in GitHub with explanation) in Support Materials - 2 hours;
       - Read support material, to understand: "Theory of Mechanism and Machines (1988) I.I. Artobolevskii" (pages about Structural Analysis and Kinematics)
       - Kinematics on blank list , now in process in Matlab Coding this kinematics (link to GitHub in References)
       - CAD (download soft - understand how to work with it, watch course: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL40d7srwyc_Ow4aaOGXlP2idPGwD7ruKg) - 2 hours
       - Kinematics not finished (in process of finishing in code) in KinematicsGripper.m - 5 hours + 0.5-1 for blank list in Support Material: Kinematics1.
   
       
#### - II Iteration:

       - Calculations, to see which motor I need - 2 hours;
       - Dynamics(strength requirements, fully static, no dynamics, choose lengths for gripper links) - 6 hours, in DynamicsGripper.m;
       - Finish Kinematics - 4 hours, to make graphs to see dependencies of motor angle and position of one point, in KinematicsGripper.m;
       - To think that without stopping the engine, the mechanism continues to move and how - 2-4 hours;
       - Verification, movement work - 4-5 hours;
       - Optimizations in CAD - 5 hours;
       - Checking the real balance in power - 3-4 hours;
       - Making model in 3D printer - not estimated yet
