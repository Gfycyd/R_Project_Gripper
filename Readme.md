## Course Project "Robotics Gripper"

#### - I Iteration:

       - Open a review article and choose a flu scheme, modeling complexity - 1 hours;       
                             https://grabcad.com/library/robot-arm-gripper-1
                                          Advantages:
                - Self-locking mechanism;
                - Good for task to grab a brick;
                - Exist giff to see how mechanism can work => better understanding;

                                        Disadvantages: 
                - Can be slow, need fast motor;
                
       - Chosen scheme structural analysis (pictures in GitHub with explanation) in Support Materials - 2 hours;
       - Read support material, to understand: "Theory of Mechanism and Machines (1988) I.I. Artobolevskii" (pages about Structural Analysis and Kinematics) - 5-6 hours
       - Kinematics on blank list , now in process in Matlab Coding this kinematics (GitHub in Support Material: Kinematics1 and KinematicsFile.pdf) - 1 hour;
       - CAD (download soft - understand how to work with it, watch course: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL40d7srwyc_Ow4aaOGXlP2idPGwD7ruKg) - 2 hours
       - Kinematics not finished (in process of finishing in code) in KinematicsGripper.m - 5 hours 
       - Meeting with superviser - 0.5 hour;
   
       
#### - II Iteration:
       - Finish Kinematics - 6 hours, to make graphs to see dependencies of motor angle and position of one point, in KinematicsGripper.m;
 
       - Calculations, to see which motor I need - 2 hours;
       - Dynamics(strength requirements, stopping conditions, fully static, no dynamics, choose lengths for gripper links + read book, already mentioned) - 6 hours, in DynamicsGripper.m;
       - To think that without stopping the engine, the mechanism continues to move and how - 0.5 hour;
       - Meeting with supervisor - 0.5 hour;
       - How to connect to the engine - 2-3 hours


#### - III Iteration: 

       -  Optimizations in CAD - 5 hours
       -  CAD model - 15 hours
       -  Find brick - 0.5 hour
       -  Meeting with supervisor - 0.5 hour
       -  Moving points in Kinematics in Matlab - 2 hours
       -  Changing something in Dynamics.pdf file (check it and change)

#### - IV Iteration: 
       - Presentation to supervisor - 0.5 
       - Meeting with supervisor - 0.5
       - Checking the real balance in power - 3-4 hours;
       - Learn to drive the engine - 5 hours
       - Making model in 3D printer - 8 hours
